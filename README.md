# tpximpact-takehomechallenge

1. Part one is a simple exercise where you will replicate a poster using HTML and CSS.
Please pick one poster and reproduce it using just HTML and CSS (no images), it does not need to be responsive, but it should look correct in modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Microsoft Edge.

2. For this task you will create a HTML page with a functional stopwatch. The stopwatch must have the following features:
- [ ] Time display: The current elapsed time in the following format 00:00:00:00 (hours, minutes, seconds, centiseconds)
- [ ] Start button: A button to start or continue a timer.
- [ ] Pause button: A button to pause the running timer.
- [ ] Reset button: A button to reset the timer to zero.

Bonus points:

- [ ] Lap button: A button to write the time to a list/table of laps (this would not pause the timer). The results should be shown on screen and still be visible if the page is refreshed.
- [ ] Clear lap history button: A button to clear any lap history
- [ ] Make it look good
- [ ] No bugs or quirky behaviour... (is keeping good time?)
- [ ] Any build tools, instructions or other things you think a good project should include

We are looking for the following:
- We will only be testing in Chrome
- These are intended to give us a feel for how you work as a developer and your level of experience and technical ability.
- Approach is more important than framework. By all means use your tool of choice but we won't judge.
